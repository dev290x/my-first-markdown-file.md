# Hello Markdown

It is **5000** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get hang of *it*, you just:

*Remember the basic syntax\
*Write your doc
*Done!

Now you can be a Wiz at the language and code up stuff like 'console.writeline("HelloMarkdown!");

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
